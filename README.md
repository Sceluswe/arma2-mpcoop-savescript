# Introduction
Arma2 and Arma2:Operation Arrowhead cannot properly load multiplayer coop saves. When executed this script will create a backup folder and store each save inside it. Further it will clean the original save directory so that you can keep saving your game. So far you'll have to execute this script whenever you've saved your multiplayer coop game 6 times. Arma2 doesn't allow you to save any more than that, it'll simply refuse to save your game.

# Further Improvements
1. Make the script a background process so the user can continue to play and save their game without ever having to execute the script more than once (before they start their arma2 coop game).
